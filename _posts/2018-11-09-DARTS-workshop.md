<p>On Friday the 9th of November the first workshop of Delft Advanced Research Terra Simulator (DARTS) took place. The workshop mainly focussed on introducing and learning how to use the flexible DARTS modeling software for Geothermal Processes using Python. First part of the workshop was set-up using the Jupyter Notebook environment. Setting up a simple simulation test case, initializing the engine, running the engine, and finally visualizing the result. Second part of the workshop included the simulation of a heterogeneous 3D model, now executed in the PyCharm IDE.</p>

<p>The workshop was a great success, for both MSc. students and staff members of the Civil Engineering and Geosciences (CEG) faculty at Delft University of Technology (TUD). The following photo was taken after the workshop.</p>
